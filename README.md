# Covid-19_Analysis_On_PowerBI

In the Project, I studied about the rate of Covid-19 cases turning to death over the world. For this study, I used raw data set as “csv file” which I got from “www.kaggle.com” . This gave comprehensive information about Covid-19 implementatitons between 01.2020 to 02.2021. Thanks to that, I was able to make visualized analyzes and view the details. For his I used the Microsoft Power BI tool. 
The reasons I chose the Power BI tool were that Power BI was both very easy to learn and a very advanced tool for graphing and visualizing the data. The fact that allowing simultaneous online works of Power BI was also one of the importanat reason why I chose Power BI, because being able to work simultaneously was very useful, while I was doing the homework as a group work. FirstI investigated the raw data and made a cleaning process on it, after that I chose the information and the graphics to visualise it as dashboards.
In this report, I especially tried to find and explain which continent affected the most and  why? Every country explain the situations to their own citizen and so that I know limited information about the global condition. I got some information from the social media but not enough detailed. Unfortunately every daya lot of people are dying, virus is spreading and this effect all the conturies.  This is why I chose this subject for a project. And after I analysed it , I think I have created a very effective resource for those who work on the distribution of Covid-19 cases to regions thanks to the visualization I do in Power BI. 
 	If I interpret our work in detail from left to rigth and up to down on the dashboard:
•	In  pivot table, I compared the death rates of Covid-19 cases on the basis of continents. According to these results, I observed that the highest mortality rate was in South America, then Europe, North America, Asia, Africa and Oceanica.
•	In 2nd graphic, I visualized the number of Covid-19 cases on a monthly basis and the number of deaths in these months, and I observed an increasing number by date.
•	In 3rd praphic, I tried to show the regions with the highest number of Covid-19 cases and deaths on the map using the active world map. Each buuble shows the countries and when the size of the bubbles gets bigger the death rates also get bigger.
•	In 4th graphic, I see the population density. As I see Europe and Asia have the most population density acording to land area.
•	In 5th graphic, I compared the number of people vaccinated on the basis of continents and the number of Covid-19 cases, and as a result, I saw that Europe took the lead and then Asia comes in both vaccination and the number of Covid-19 cases.
•	In 6th graphic, I have revealed how much Covid-19 tests are performed on which continent on a daily basis. South America has the first place, and then North America, Oceanica, Europe, Asia and Africa is coming.
•	In 7th grapgic, I can see the place where the most 65-year-old deaths rate occurred with the emergence of Covid-19 and I see that Europe (0.24 M) takes the lead here.
•	In 8th graphic, I obtained the number of deaths on a continent basis based on cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, extreme poverty and smokers. Our aim here was to find the biggest health problem that trigger the death of the patients. I saw that it is cardiovascular diseases.
•	In our last graphic, I have revealed the mortality rates by referring to million population on continent basis to give an idea about our other Covid-19 based graphics. As a result, I saw that the highest number of deaths occurred in Europe out and away.

In a conclusion, I can say that virus is spreading day by day and older people are under big risk. But cardiovascular diseases have the biggest priority between health problems. Making test is not the most important part . And also I haven’t seen the affects and success  of the vaccines already. If I look Europe and Asia the biggest problem is crowdedness of people, although alot of people have been vaccinated. The goverments are taking precautions but I think it isn’t enough. I don’t have to forget, here comes different new mutations and the solution is making enough distance, getting clean and wearing masks.
